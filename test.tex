\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{A)}
$a(bb)^*(ab)^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $a(bb)^*(ab)^*$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ words must start with an $a$ and be followed by $bb$ or $ab$.\\

In order to form the word $abab$ one must be able to follow $a$ with $ba$. As such, it is impossible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{B)}
$ab^*a^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $ab^*a*$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ words must start with an $ab$ and be followed by $b$ or $a$.\\

In order to form the word $abab$ one must be able to follow $ab$ with $ab$. As such, it is impossible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{C)}
$a(ba)^*b^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $a(ba)^*b^*$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ one can assign a value of $1$ to the first and second exponent. This would result in $abab$.\\

As such, it is possible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{D)}
$a^*ba(a\cup b)$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $a^*ba(a\cup b)$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ one can assign a value of $1$ to the first exponent and choose b over a in $(a\cup b)$. This would result in $abab$.\\

As such, it is possible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{E)}
$(ab)^*(bb)^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $(ab)^*(bb)^*$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ one can assigns a value of $2$ to the first exponent and $0$ to the second exponent. This would result in $abab$.\\

As such, it is possible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{F)}
$a^*(ba \cup bb)^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $a^*(ba \cup bb)^*$ and $wL$ be a word formed with this language.\\

Given the definition of $L$ words must start with a $a$, $ba$ or $bb$. The only scenario where it would be possible to form the words $abab$ is if $wL$ begins with $a$. Following $a$ the only options are $ba$ or $bb$ followed again by $ba$ or $bb$.\\

In order to form the word $abab$ one must be able to follow $a$ with $bab$. As such, it is impossible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{G)}
$a^*(ba)^*bb$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $a^*(ba)^*bb$ and $wL$ be a word formed with this language.\\

Given the definition of $L$ words must start with a $a$, $ba$ or $bb$. The only scenario where it would be possible to form the words $abab$ is if $wL$ begins with $a$. Following $a$ the only options are $ba^*$ or $bb^*$.\\

In order to form the word $abab$ one must be able to follow $a$ with $bab$. As such, it is impossible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
\subsection*{H)}
$ab(ab \cup a)b^*$\\
Let $L$ represent the regular language described by $ab(ab \cup a)b^*$.\\

Given the definition of $L$ one can assigns a value of $0$ to the exponent and choose ab over a. This would result in $abab$.\\

As such, it is possible to construct the word $abab$ with this language $L$.
